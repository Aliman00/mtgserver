### Welcome to the mtgserver.

This server is specifically for new post 14.1 content and server modifications compatible with Core3. They have been created and submitted by the SWG community. The new content is available for any server to use with just one restriction: We ask that you give full credit to the creator for their work on your server's website and not claim it as your own work. Thank you.

Head to the Wiki for more detailed info.

If you wish to submit work for inclusion in this repo, please do so via the MTG Server Content page [**here**](http://www.modthegalaxy.com/forums/forum-server-content). Full credit will be given for all work submitted.

The complete set of consolidated tre files are [**here.**](https://mega.nz/#F!fw0EzZ4I!RfRwyqE859Ad3kGlQv7T4Q) These contain all the usual Pre-CU assets plus everything that has been added so far.

* All standard Pre-CU assets
* All post 14.1 Weapons
* CU Armor - Katarn, Rebel Assault/Battle, Imperial Assualt & Scout Troopers
* Mustafar Mobs & NPC's
* Kashyyyk Mobs and worldbuilding assets
* Many NGE Mobs
* Chiss Backpack
* BARC Speeder
* NGE Housing

This is now starting to be updated again, with the hope that a ZonamaDev image will be available in the not too distant future.

It's purpose is to add all of the NGE assets and anything released by the kind contributors to the MTG website.

The core3 files are a stock version of the SWGEmu unstable branch. Scripts will be added for all new content. Please test, and if you find any problems, please post to the above address

**NOTE** 
I wouldn't recommend using this repo as a base for a public server. It's meant to be an asset source not a working server, although it'll still work as one. No guarantee's as it's the unstable branch from SWGEmu. Definitely no support offered for public servers.
